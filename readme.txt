This is a read me file for colorIdentifier.  

This program will (assuming I don't run out of time) have to following features.
[] the ability to open an image file in a rectangle inside a window (using pygame)
[] file is specfied in a text box in that same window
[] a thread will be constantly checking to see if the users mouse is clicking a color
	if it is it will update the color the user is identifying and will pass
	the data outside the thread [this may have to be passed to another thread]
	(so the thread can get back to checking for
	another click)


concepts will be tested before a final program is started.
[] getting user input from a text box in a thread...  then pass the string allong to 
	get displayed on the pygame window
