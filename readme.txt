This is a read me file for colorIdentifier.  

This program will (assuming I don't run out of time) have to following features.
[] the ability to open an image file in a rectangle inside a window (using pygame)
[] file is specfied in a text box in that same window
[] a thread will be constantly checking to see if the users mouse is clicking a color
	if it is it will update the color the user is identifying and will pass
	the data outside the thread [this may have to be passed to another thread]
	(so the thread can get back to checking for
	another click)


concepts will be tested before a final program is started.
[] getting user input from a text box in a thread...  then pass the string allong to 
	get displayed on the pygame window

	JUST USE THE INCLUDED PYBRARY FOR THIS PROJECT... BUT MAKE SURE TO USE 
	THE LATEST VERSION IN OTHER PROJECTS... wow im really not good at read mes
	I cant beleve I'm going to upload the above paragraph.
